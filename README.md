# Google-Form-Raffle-Entries
Made using Google Apps Scripts (through google forms script editor)

The script enables multiple entries to a google sheet depending on the number of correct answers a respondent guesses in a google form raffle. For each correct guess, a new row is added to the spreadsheet so a contestant may have multiple entries dependent on their correctness.

Best method to pick winners is through a random number generator (randomnumbergenerator.com).

To use this script:
  1. Have a google form and a google sheet
  2. Ensure the google form has questions for the raffle that are worth 1 mark each (0 marks for name, grade, etc.)
  3. Include in script editor of the form
  4. Change links, dates, and other items depending on things wanted to print on google sheet
  5. Add a trigger so functions are run on form submission
